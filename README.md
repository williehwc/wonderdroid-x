# WonderDroid Ultra

WonderDroid Ultra (formerly WonderDroid X) is an emulator of the Bandai Wonderswan and Wonderswan Color handheld game consoles for Android. It is a fork of WonderDroid, originally written by [Daniel Palmer](https://github.com/danielgpalmer) for older versions of Android and later imported from [Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/wonderdroid). I have forked his project to bring it up to date, fix bugs, and improve performance.
